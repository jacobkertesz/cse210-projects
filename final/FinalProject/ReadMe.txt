This project is a creature simulating game, and 
here are a few things you should know to use it.

1. You will be asked for how many Creatures to run.
    3 Creatures seems to work the best, but it is capable of handling more.
    Additionally, an extra creature called Hunter will be added.

2. After you choose how many Creatures will be simulated,
    the program will show each creatures' info. You are not required to 
    understand what it all means, but here is a short summary.

    For most of these, 6 is the highest/strongest.

    ID is the creatures ID or name.
    Traits and Levels shows what traits the creature has and how strong they trait is.
    Trace is their likelyhood to stay in one spot.
    Attack is their attack behavior.
    Activity is when the creature is active (diurnal = day, nocturnal = night, etc).
    And aggression is how aggressive they are initially.

3. After continuing, the simulation will run for 1 round (in-game day and night)
    and update important info to you. 
    You will see somthing like this:

    458[HP(6) A 6] Meadow
    This is the creature's ID, their health, their status, their aggression, and their location in that order.

    There are 4 statuses that can appear. A is Active, Z is Inactive, ? means the it has sensed a creature, and dead is well the creature is dead.

4. The simulation will only end when the user enters n when the Continue prompt appears.
